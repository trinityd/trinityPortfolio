		Trust Your Own Path

		<i>“Being in a minority, even in a minority of one, did not make you mad. There was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you were not mad.”</i> — From <i>1984</i>, by George Orwell.<br><br>

		There are a number of possible paths to walk upon in high school. Many, including two of my closest, longest friends, chose one paved with alcohol and drugs. To me, it didn’t seem like a very useful road to walk on, built with terrible materials and leading nowhere good. For much longer than I should have, I tried to remain friends with these people while staying distant from their vices. Soon, I found that these relationships had become one sided. After growing up moving around a lot, I had finally settled down and made friendships I thought would last forever, but it suddenly seemed like they were ending. I was honestly heartbroken. Some of my best friends didn’t seem to like me any more — because I didn’t like to drink and do drugs? How could this happen? <br><br>

		For a long time, I considered it a failure of my own to “be cool,” and decided that the best way to get my friends back would be to start partying with them. I hated it. I felt like I was ruining my body and mind every time I went out. I woke up after a particularly long night with my friends and their group, and then and there, lying in bed, the puke drying on the carpet, my head pounding out of my skull, decided that I was going to choose to stop. I realized that trying to stay friendly with my “friends,” who would only be conditionally close to me with the caveat of getting wasted, was poisoning my life. <br><br>

		I resolved to never again let someone drag me down a path like that. I want an extraordinary life, spent doing things I love, filled with passion, exploration, and learning, not one that ends with me becoming a burnout without ambition. It had taken a while, but eventually I’d realized that my inner, guiding voice was the one I should listen to in order to achieve my ideal life, no matter how many try to replace it with their own. It was a concept that I’d heard abstractly before, in maxims like “always be yourself,” or “follow your heart.” But I’d never really encountered it within myself. I had made a mistake in following the majority in order to be accepted. <br><br>

		There will never be a “right way to be” that I have to follow in order to have positive relationships with my friends. Instead, there will only be the way I decide to live my life, the way I think will make it the best possible, and friends worth having will stick with me through it! Coming to this realization gave me strength, and soon, I wasn’t stressed or saddened about being in the minority when it came to wanting to spend my time like my friends did. Instead, I felt weightless and unconstrained by the thoughts and opinions of my peers. I knew that my goals of success were going to take me to a great life, and no matter what people would think of me because of it, I decided that I was going to work hard to achieve them. <br><br>

		This was years ago, and my decisions back in high school have absolutely taken me closer to my goals. I left early for an early college program, began research in an interesting field (biometrics) outside of my major and focus (computer science), excelled in my courses, and went on service learning and business education trips to the Dominican Republic, Italy, and Germany. Focusing on my own life and refusing to bow to the pressure from people along the way who don’t have my best interests at heart has served me very well so far. <br><br>
