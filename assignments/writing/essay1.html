		What Makes A Person Good Or Bad?
	</div>
	<p>
		<i>"Think: all men make mistakes, <br>
		But a good man yields when he <br>
		Knows his course is wrong, <br>
		And repairs the evil: The only <br>
		Crime is pride."</i> <br>
		- From <i>Antigone</i>, <br>
		by Sophocles. <br><br>

		Throughout history, men and women have made mistakes. They happen, and anyone can fall from grace, or be corrupted into a baser version of their own persona. Sophocles’ claim in this passage from Antigone is that what separates the strong from the weak, the “good” from the “bad”, and the truly evil from the (at some level) pure is how each individual person chooses to react to their mistakes. Would you, having realized you insulted a friend without realizing it, simply move on with your day, or go back and try to repair the damage made to your relationship? If you chose the latter option, and attempted to swallow your pride and humbly admit your mistakes, Sophocles would have branded you a good man. But men and women exist who commit misdeeds, as small as mistreatment of a family member, or, as a slightly more impactful example, ruining or ending the lives of millions through the squandering of their power. There is a certain line to be drawn when looking for pridefulness as a measure of evil in a man or woman. Rather than looking for how a person reacts to their mistakes, crimes, and general misdeeds, look to what they do in the first place as a measure of if they are “good” or not. <br><br>

		Would we have forgiven Adolf Hitler for his bigoted and Anti-Semitic genocide, if instead of ending his life in a bunker near the end of World War II, he had walked out, and proudly proclaimed to the world that he had gloriously realized “what a bad path he had
		been walking on, how much, like, bad mojo he was bringing to the world, and how he,
		totally, wanted to make it better”? I don’t think so. His actions would have outweighed his apparent want for reparations, and he would have been punished accordingly, as a way to show future Hitlers that that path brings nothing but destruction and ruin — and not just to the others that they may or may not care about. However, if a person who, purely by accident, ran over their neighbor family’s beloved cat, and came rushing into their house with the pet in their arms, a broken heart in their chest, and a burning need to make their sorrow clear, a different outcome in terms of forgiveness would most likely happen. <br><br>

		When looking at how much pridefulness in one’s choices determines how “good” or “evil” someone is, there are several factors to consider. Besides the degree of how “bad” their actions were (which is purely subjective, but using any sort of “morality scale”, most would rate Hitler as “worse” than the guy who wasn’t looking at the road), obviously one must consider if the person who committed the crime or misdeed did it on purpose with malice in their heart. A small dog, newly adopted, who goes to the bathroom in a place where he shouldn’t and is scolded — but he is not hated more so and thought of as “bad” if he continues to do the same. He isn’t doing the deed with an intention of angering anyone or ruining anyone’s day — he just doesn’t know better yet. <br><br>

		“Evil” is a messy subject. It is entirely subjective. No one man or woman has ever or will ever be able to define each and every man or woman’s actions as good or evil. And looking at how a person reacts to their mistakes — with pride, or with humility — is great, when the crime is of a certain nature. But after a certain moral and impactfully defined line in the sand has been crossed, there is only one way to judge the character of a person: by their actions. Genocide, murder, rape and other such ways to end and ruin lives are just too “evil” to be forgiven through humility and repentance — again, this is according to the inner sense of morals that drives most humans the same way. No matter what Hitler attempted to convince you of after the fact, you would not let him chaperone your kids at a slumber party — and this unequivocal moral decision is proof that, against what Sophocles believed, pride in your actions is not always the determining factor of a man or woman’s “badness.” <br><br>
